# Soft Gray Dos

It's like Soft Gray, but with a "Dos" at the end.

Also, there's some tiny things fixed. Like radio buttons all looking selected and text alignment as well.

## How to use...

Wakanda creates a Theme folder during install. More info [here](http://doc.wakanda.org/Architecture-of-Wakanda-Applications/Custom-Theme.200-1024475.en.html).

### Step One

Clone into your Wakanda Studio's Theme folder.

```batch
cd WAKANDA_HOME/Themes
git clone https://github.com/Guamaso/wakandaTheme_softGrayDos.git softGrayDos
```
Or you can [browse to the repo](https://github.com/Guamaso/wakandaTheme_softGrayDos) and click the "Download ZIP" link. Make sure you rename the zipped folder to `softGrayDos`.

### Step Two

Open desired page in Wakanda. Select the `body` element. Click on the "Design" tab in the properties pane. Select `softGrayDos` from the list of available themes.

You may need to restart Studio in order for the theme to display properly in the editor.

You should also clear the cache of your browser and restart Wakanda Server.

### Step Three

Repeat Step Two for all applicable pages in the project.
